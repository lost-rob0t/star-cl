* Star-cl
Port of starintel-doc to common lisp

Mostly will be used by hackmode and starintel-gserver.


** Differences from doc-nim

+ Person doesnt inherit from eid
+ there is no testing for in-scope or out-scope




** Future plans

This version of the spec, one day will be the defacto stanadard and will be used to generate other spec libs. It gets old re-writing this stuff by hand and most of it is very basic, no advanced functionality other then setting fields

See [[file:./TODO.org][Todo list]] for list of stuff i havent done yet
